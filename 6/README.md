# AoC - Day 6

[https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)

My solution for part 1 worked with the quantities of fish with each age, rather than having to track individual fish.  This meant that nothing extra was required to implement part 2, which would have scaled poorly if individual fish were being tracked.

TIL:

- No particular learnings today. It was very convenient to use `pop(0)` to simultaneously get (and remove) the first element from the list.
