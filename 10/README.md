# AoC - Day 10

My code is a bit scrappy for this challenge, but I think the approach is reasonable. I process each line character by character and maintain a stack of what closing brackets are expected. This provides the basis of the solution for both parts of the challenge, the remainder of the work is just calculating scores.
