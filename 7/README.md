# AoC - Day 7

Fairly straightforward. I could have written the loops as list comprehensions, but the loops were just a little bit quicker and more readable for me. Also I suspect that there may be a more efficient way than brute forcing the solution, maybe by using the median positions? However I didn't pursue this as I'm short on time today.

TIL:

- Reminded myself that the nth triangular number can be found with `n(n+1)/2`
