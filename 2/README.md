# AoC - Day 2

Not much to say about this challenge, it's fairly straightforward. It's nice to use tuple unpacking in the for loops, to avoid having to access the data by index.  It also allows using a descriptive variable.

I have used descriptive variable names throughout rather than x, y etc. Of course this is a little slower to type, and can make the code look a bit chunky.  However it can also help to avoid mistakes with muddling up variables, or forgetting which directions your co-ordinates go.
